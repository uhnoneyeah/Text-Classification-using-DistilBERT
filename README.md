# LLM Text Classification with Hugging Face Transformers

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained large language model (LLM) for text classification using the Hugging Face `transformers` library. The goal is to build a text classifier using a transformer model like BERT, fine-tune it on a dataset, and evaluate its performance.

## Project Overview

In this project, we use the Hugging Face `transformers` library to fine-tune a pre-trained transformer model, such as `bert-base-uncased`, on a text classification task. The model is trained on labeled text data and evaluated on a validation set. The steps include data preprocessing, model fine-tuning, and evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to install the following Python packages:

- `transformers`: The Hugging Face library for pre-trained transformer models.
- `datasets`: The library to easily load datasets.
- `torch`: The core PyTorch library for model training.
- `scikit-learn`: A library for evaluation metrics like accuracy.

You can install these dependencies via `pip` by using the appropriate command.

## Dataset

This project requires a dataset for text classification. The dataset should contain two main columns:

- `text`: The textual data you want to classify.
- `label`: The corresponding label for each text.

The dataset is typically split into training and validation sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for validation.

## Steps to Run the Code

1. **Import Required Libraries**: Begin by importing the necessary libraries such as `transformers`, `datasets`, and `torch`.
2. **Load and Preprocess the Dataset**: Load the dataset using the `datasets` library. Tokenize the text using a pre-trained tokenizer like `bert-base-uncased` and preprocess it (padding and truncation) to ensure consistent text length.
3. **Split the Dataset**: Divide the dataset into training and validation sets, typically with an 80-20 split.
4. **Initialize the Model**: Load a pre-trained transformer model such as `bert-base-uncased` for text classification.
5. **Define Evaluation Metrics**: Set up evaluation metrics like accuracy to track the model's performance during training and validation.
6. **Set Training Arguments**: Configure training parameters such as batch sizes, epochs, and evaluation strategies.
7. **Train the Model**: Fine-tune the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the validation set.
8. **Save the Model**: After training, save the fine-tuned model and tokenizer for future use or deployment.

## Evaluation

After the model is trained, it can be evaluated on the validation set. Evaluation is typically performed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess how well the model is classifying the texts.

## Expected Results

The goal of this project is to create a fine-tuned transformer model capable of classifying text data based on the provided labels. Once trained, the model can be used to classify unseen text, providing valuable insights for applications such as sentiment analysis or topic categorization.

## Next Steps

- **Deploy the Model**: The trained model can be deployed for real-time text classification tasks.
- **Experiment with Other Models**: Try fine-tuning other pre-trained models like RoBERTa, GPT, or T5 for comparison.
- **Handle Imbalanced Datasets**: Explore methods to handle class imbalance, such as weighted loss functions or oversampling.
- **Improve the Model**: Experiment with different hyperparameters, learning rates, and training epochs to improve model performance.

Feel free to modify and customize the code as needed for your specific use case, dataset, and requirements.
